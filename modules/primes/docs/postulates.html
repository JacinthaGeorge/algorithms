		<h1>The postulates found myself</h1>

		<ol>
			<li>1 is the single super-prime number.</li>
			<li>In decimal radix system all prime numbers except 2 and 5 are ended with 1, 3, 7, 9.</li>
			<li>To prove that a number is NOT a prime it is enough to check whether it is greater than 5
			    and ended not with 1, 3, 7, 9; and if not so,
			    then try dividing it by all prime numbers which are less than the square root (sqrt) from the number.
			    If we tried to divide N by all prime dividers less than sqrt(N) and found no integer quotient, then the
			    number is prime, otherwise it is not.
			</li>
