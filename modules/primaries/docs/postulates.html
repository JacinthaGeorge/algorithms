		<h1>The postulates found myself</h1>

		<ol>
			<li>1 is the single super-primary number.</li>
			<li>In decimal radix system all primary numbers except 2 and 5 are ended with 1, 3, 7, 9.</li>
			<li>To prove that a number is NOT primary it is enough to check whether it is greater than 5
			    and ended not with 1, 3, 7, 9; and if not so,
			    then try dividing it by all primary numbers which are less than the square root (sqrt) from the number.
			    If we tried to divide N by all primary dividers less than sqrt(N) and found no integer quotient, then the
			    number is primary, otherwise it is not.
